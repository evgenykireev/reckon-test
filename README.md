# Reckon coding test
This is an implementation of Reckon NodeJs Pre-Interview Coding Test

# Usage
To start the application 
```
npm run start
```

After the application has started, there will be two endpoints available

Test 1:
```
http://localhost:9999/
```

Test 2:
```
http://localhost:9999/subText
```

# Notes about implementation
* The application is auto generated by [express-generator](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html)
* JavaScript code is ES6  
* [requestretry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/requestretry) npm module is used to implement auto retry for failing http requests. 
  Currently it's configured for `maxAttempts: 10`, `retryDelay: 500`
* For Subtext test a simple bruit force algorithm O(mn) is used to find substring occurrences. Depending on performance 
requirements and input (size of text and number of subtexts) it should be changed to a [more advanced](http://www-igm.univ-mlv.fr/~lecroq/string/index.html) 
algorithm

### Testing
 Run
 ```
npm run test
```
